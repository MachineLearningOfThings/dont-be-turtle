## About

### Description

This Donâ€™t be a Turtle Project makes all of IT people have right posture and feel good while they are working! 
We investigate a mobile machine learning based methodology providing 
feedbacks with respect to your neck posture. 
For this purpose, we monitor neck, detecting 
whether you are maintaining good working posture. 
If you are working in an overhanging posture, you will be alerted to maintain a good posture.
